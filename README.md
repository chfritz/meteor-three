# Three.js - A JavaScript 3D library, repackaged for Meteor.

This is a simple Meteor package for including Three.js in a Meteor project using the Meteor package manager. Because Three.js contains several useful featuers hidden away in the examples folder I've included a couple of extra files that I use frequently along with the main Three.js.

For extra info on Three.js or Meteor please refer to their respective homepages:

[Three.js](http://threejs.org)

[Meteor](http://meteor.com)


## How to install 
Like any other Meteor package you can simply run the following from the command line: 

`meteor add chfritz:three`

## Notes
I'll try to keep this package up to date with each Three.js release. I'm pretty busy though, so feel free to either message me or update the library yourself if I miss a release.
